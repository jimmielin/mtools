Welcome to **mtools**, a toolkit for atmospheric chemistry research using MATLAB/Octave.

This repository contains a set of different tools for retrieving, handling, and analyzing data.
It is not a full-fledged package (yet), but it will grow (hopefully).
It includes a set of useful scripts that will assist in research and make working with data less painful,
especially taking care of making things "generic" enough for use in the future.

This package was developed during my personal time. It is licensed under MIT, which is quite permissive.
However, I remind that I do not assume any sort of warranty, express or implied, for the use of this package,
including the possible danger of caffeine overdose, late nights, and generally debugging frustration.
